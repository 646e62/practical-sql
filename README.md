## Practical SQL: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data

[PracticalSQL](https://www.nostarch.com/practicalSQL) by Anthony DeBarros focuses on using SQL (Structured Query Language) to find the story your data tells, using the open-source database PostgreSQL and the pgAdmin interface as primary tools. It's scheduled to be published in February 2018 by [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com). Early Access is available now via No Starch.

## What's Here

**Code**: All code listings from each chapter, organized in chapter folders.

**Data**: When needed, CSV files for importing. Also organized by chapter.

**Exercises**: The "Try It Yourself" questions and answers for each chapter are listed separately. Try working through the questions before peeking at the answers!

## Getting the Code and Data on Your Computer

**Non-GitHub Users**
Easiest way to obtain all the code and data at once is to download this repository as a .zip file. To do that:

* Select the **Clone or Download** button at top right.
* Select **Download ZIP**
* You can then unzip the file on your computer. Place it in a directory that's easy to remember so you can reference it during the exercises that include importing data to PostgreSQL.

**GitHub Users**
GitHub users may want to clone the repo locally and occasionally perform a `git pull` for any updates.

## Note to Early Access Users

Editing and technical review of the book is in progress, so some code likely will change between now and publication in February 2018. You can follow edits in the [commit history](https://github.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/commits/master).
